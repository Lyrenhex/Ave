# Ave
A material design IRC client written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using electron/electron.

## In development
Please note that Ave is **in active development**. (This is why the `master` branch is empty; there is no deployable code.) There may be bugs, and some features / functionality may not even be implemented yet.

*This branch is focused on design. Functionality comes later.*

## Contributing
Feel free to dive in to the code and help out - I won't bite! Alternatively, you could suggest ideas or report bugs in the issue tracker?

Either way, contributions are fine, and appreciated!
