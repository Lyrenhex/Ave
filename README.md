A material design IRC client written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).

## Official IRC Channel
Ave has an official IRC channel for discussion, operating at `#ave-irc` on `irc.freenode.net`.  Please feel free to join at any point to discuss various topics (normally concerning Ave...).

## In development
Please note that Ave is **in active development**. There may be bugs, and some features / functionality may not even be implemented yet.

*Note that the contents of this branch will usually be capable of running; cases where this is not the case __should be reported__. However, it will still be in development, so features may not yet be implemented / only half set up.*

## Installing
Currently, there are no binary builds of Ave. In order to launch Ave (from source), you should:

1. Download Node.JS
2. Clone the `master` branch
    1. Run `git clone https://github.com/Scratso/Ave.git` (assuming you have Git installed)
3. In the command line (Windows Command Prompt, or Linux Terminal), within the folder you cloned Ave into in step 2:
    1. Run `npm install` to install required dependencies (including electron and material-design-lite)
    2. Run `npm start` to run Ave.
4. All should work at this point; if it doesn't, submit an issue!
