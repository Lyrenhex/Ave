                    <h2>Ave is free</h2>
                    <p>Proprietary software is flawed. In almost every way. Plus, it hinders the natural evolutionary progression of software projects, and leaves you, as a user, unsure as to exactly <i>what</i> it is that the software does <b>behind the scenes</b>,
                        for you have no access to the program's souce code.</p>
                    <p>Considering this, we who work on Ave can promise that Ave will <i><b>always be 100% free</b></i> both in terms of cost (woop!) <b>and</b> your freedom to do as you wish with the source. We've even been kind enough to license Ave under the
                        GNU General Public License version 3 (or, at your discretion, any later version).</p>
                    <p>Oh yeah, and we <b>don't</b> collect <i>any</i> of your data when you use Ave, so there's no need to worry! Just dig in to the code and see for yourself.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h2>Style each message exactly how you want</h2>
                    <p>Markdown is pretty popular these days, huh? Cool. That's why we've worked Markdown into the Ave IRC Client, allowing you to emphasise text with asterisks (*s), post neat links, and format code to make your chatter as simple and easy to
                        understand as possible, both for you, and your recipients! Even better, all messages sent by other people are parsed for markdown (so *important details* stand out more), letting you converse naturally, as though Markdown was always a part
                        of the IRC spec!</p>
                    <p>And don't worry if your friends all use HexChat: they'll either all want to be cool and switch to Ave eventually... or all of your fancy markdown messages will degrade gracefully in their clients, to get your point across without them having a
                        markdown parser. The wonders of the modern world, eh?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h2>Light as a feather</h2>
                    <p>Ave is built to have few files and a small size (~150 megabytes, at the time of writing), allowing Ave to be used often on even the most depraved of computers (at least, when it comes to storage space!),
                        so that you can keep being productive, even if your hard drive is filled with funny memes and cat videos. (No, we don't care much for cats, really. Memes though...)</p>
                    <p>Besides, are you a hardcore gamer that has a bazillion monitors across your wall, who just happens to like IRC? You'll <i>love</i> Ave, since it runs really fast and hardly even touches your framerate. Perfect
                        for bashing the hell out of a bunch of demon's skulls in <i>Doom</i>, then, yeah?</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h2>Hackable to the core</h2>
                    <p>But I'd bet my diamond-plated lamborghini (not really, that thing's damn expensive) that you're a developer, right? After all, 99.99% of all IRC users are software developers, according to the <abbr title="Nonexistant study
                        that manages to make you think it exists">NSTMTMYTIE</abbr>, and - come on, now - would we really lie to you?</p>
                    <p>Ave is hackable to the core, being <a href="http://github.com/Scratso/Ave" target="_blank">open source on GitHub</a>, and structured in such a way as to make developing and extending Ave a summer breeze! ... In fact,
                        we'd love to have you on the team. Why not <a href="http://github.com/Scratso/Ave" target="_blank">contribute</a>?</p>
