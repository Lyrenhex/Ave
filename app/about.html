        <div class="content notice">
            <h2>Ave is in <b>active development</b></h2>
            <p>This means a <i>lot</i>, to be honest. For example, it means that <b>this
                    document will change</b> - a lot - throughout Ave's development. That can't be
                helped, of course; details will undoubtedly change during development, some
                things described in the document may eventually become inaccurate, et cetera.
                Ave's status also means, however, that <b>many features may currently be
                    unavailable,</b> as they may in the development process or may be planned for
                later.</p>
            <p>This means that if you find any issues, bugs, discrepencies, etc, then please jump
                to the <a href="http://github.com/Scratso/Ave/issues" target="_blank">Ave Issue
                    Tracker</a> and report them there.</p>
            <p>Thanks!<br />

            <h2>About Ave</h2>
            <p>Ave is a new IRC (internet relay chat) client designed according to the Google
                Material Design style guidelines. Ave aims to modernise the increasingly dated
                IRC chat system, by using a sleek, modern design (as opposed to the many IRC
                clients that have a design much like Windows XP applications), along with
                introducing features which are more commonly found on later chat systems (such
                as a clearer reply system).</p>
            <p>Ave also serves to add to the free software community, as Ave is free - both as in
                cost, and in freedoms.</p>

            <h2>Credits</h2>
            <p>Ave, of course, would not be possible without the contributions and work of
                others. Ave, and its maintainers, would like to thank the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Scratso" target="_blank">Damian Heaton</a>,
                    for most work on Ave, as the lead developer and Ave's maintainer.</li>
                <li><a href="http://electron.atom.io" target="_blank">Electron</a>, without which
                    Ave would not have been possible.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc" target="_blank">Node-IRC</a>, which
                    massively simplified the task of IRC client communications.</li>
                <li><a href="http://soapbox.github.io/linkifyjs/" target="_blank">Linkify</a>, for
                    simplifying link parsing and powering Ave's built-in autolinker.</li>
                <li><a href="https://getmdl.io/" target="_blank">Material Design Lite</a>, for
                    providing an amazing Material Design tabs system.</li>
                <li>Any and all contributors on the <a href="https://github.com/Scratso/Ave" target="_blank">
                    GitHub repo</a>, and everyone who contributed suggestions to Ave (and put up
                    with my probably irritating moaning every now and then <sup>-Damian</sup>)</li>
