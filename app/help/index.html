        <div class="content notice">
            <h2>Ave is in <b>active development</b></h2>
            <p>This means a <i>lot</i>, to be honest. For example, it means that <b>this
                    document will change</b> - a lot - throughout Ave's development. That can't be
                helped, of course; details will undoubtedly change during development, some
                things described in the document may eventually become inaccurate, et cetera.
                Ave's status also means, however, that <b>many features may currently be
                    unavailable,</b> as they may in the development process or may be planned for
                later.</p>
            <p>This means that if you find any issues, bugs, discrepencies, etc, then please jump
                to the <a href="http://github.com/Scratso/Ave/issues" target="_blank">Ave Issue
                    Tracker</a> and report them there.</p>
            <p>Thanks!<br />

            <h2>Ave Help and Information</h2>
            <p>It should be noted that this information is intended for the <b>end user</b>. In
                the event that you are a maintainer of the project, or you're just super interested
            in more detailed information regarding Ave, you should check the
            <a href="tech.html">technical help document</a>.</p>
            <p>If you are stuck with using Ave, please see the contents of this document for assistance.</p>

            <h2>Connecting to a server</h2>
            <p>Ave intends to simplify, as much as possible, the task of connecting to servers.
            That said, there is information that Ave requires to connect you to IRC. When you launch
            Ave, you should see a connection screen. There will be three fields: <i>Server Address</i>; <i>Server Port</i>;
            and <i>Nickname</i>. There are more fields (marked as advanced), but these should not be touched
            unless you're sure you know what you're doing.</p>
            <p>The <i>Server Address</i> should be the IP Address of the intended server; by default
                this field points to the Freenode IRC network (irc.freenode.net).</p>
            <p>The <i>Server Port</i> field should be the port that the intended server operates on.
                As most IRC servers operate on port 6667, this defaults to 6667.</p>
            <p>The <i>Nickname</i> field <b>must</b> be manually set by yourself. Your nickname is
                your username on the IRC server, and is used to identify you (it is shown publicly).
                No two users on IRC may ever share a nickname; if your desired nickname is already
                in use, Ave will add a number to the end of it for you. Nicknames may be changed
                once you are connected. <b>Nicknames should not exceed 9 characters.</b> However,
                due to many servers supporting nicknames up to 30 characters, Ave will permit
                nicknames of lengths up to 30 characters.</p>
            <p>Once connected, you will enter an isolated "<a href="#syschan">Sys</a>" channel.
                <b>If you never receive the message that you have connected to the server, and
                    the channel hangs on "Connecting...",</b> then Ave has failed to establish a connection.
                You may wish to restart Ave and check your Server details.</p>
            <p><i>Please note that connection details will save once you attempt to connect to
                a server.</i></p>
