            <h2>Ave Technical Details</h2>
            <p>It should be noted that this information is intended for contributors and maintainers
                of Ave. In the event that you are a non-technical user of Ave (usually referred to as
                an end user), then you may wish to refer to the <a href="index.html">Ave Help Documentation</a>.</p>

            <h2>Connecting to a server</h2>
            <p>Ave simplifies the task of connecting to servers using the Node-IRC JavaScript Module,
            of which the majority of Ave's IRC logic and handling is based upon. When connecting to
            a server on the connection screen, there are many advanced options that may be (optionally)
            filled out. See below for details on each:</p>
            <ul><li><i>Usernames</i> are a short (~9 characters) non-unique name which precedes
                the IRC user's host information ([username]@[host]). These may be shared by multiple
                users, but cannot contain spaces, or have length > 9 characters (long usernames are
                automatically trimmed by servers).</li>
                <li><i>Realnames</i> are longer texts which may contain spaces, and are supplied to
                    clients within WHOIS requests. The IRC specification recommends supplying your
                    real name within this; by default, Ave will pre-populate it with client information.</li>
                <li><i>Text encoding</i> defines the textual encoding to force all received and sent
                    IRC messages into. IRC has no specified character set, and therefore if this is left blank,
                    no character encoding will be used. However, all Ave HTML files are encoded in UTF-8,
                    and a non-UTF8 character may render oddly within Ave. Therefore, the default encoding
                    is UTF-8.</li>
                <li>Ave features the ability to automatically attempt to reconnect to a server, upon
                    either being kicked, disconnecting, or failing to connect. By default, this behaviour will
                    not occur, though you may set a retry count and a delay between reconnect attempts (in
                    milliseconds).</li>
                <li>By default, Ave will clear all message formatting from received / sent messages. This may be disabled if desired.</li>
                <li><i>Flood protection</i> is a feature in Ave intended to prevent accidental server
                    kicks for "flooding". Defaultly off, flood protection will buffer all messages sent from
                    Ave, to prevent too many messages being sent in a short space of time. <b>This can,
                        however, have the unintended effect of responding to people late</b>.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Sending commands</h2>
            <p>As of currently, the Ave input field cannot send commands to IRC servers. However,
            basic actions (such as joining channels, changing nicks, private messages) are possible via
            the Ave side-menu.</p>
            <p>Command input is planned for the future.</p>
